In DESCRIPTION:

  - Add a package in the "Depends" section if you want all that pkg
    exported functions to be visible after loading your pkg.

      * Since it is handy to call test_package() after installation of
        a new pkg it makes sense to add "testthat" to the list of
        package dependencies
 
  - Add a package in the "Imports" section if you want just some of
    those functions to be visible _only_ within the code of the
    functions you are exporting or using to implement the pkg
    functionality

      * log4r::debug() is called within rseedpkg::f1() and
        rseedpkg::f2(), hence there is no need to import the whole
        log4r pkg. Obviouly you'll also need log4r::create.logger()
        but we can go around that by making rseedpkg provide a wrapper
        for that.


In NAMESPACE:

  - Detail functions you import from other packages and functions in
    this pkg that you are exporting.
